# compressgame
A data compression tutorial in the form of a programming game. Given a list of alphabetically sorted English words in `words.txt`, write an algorithm that converts that word list into a Python program that prints the word list. The goal is to create a program whose source code is as small as possible. Ideally, this program will be much smaller than the original ASCII word list.
